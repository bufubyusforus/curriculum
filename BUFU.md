## BUFU How To: Collective Organizing By Us For Us

## Jazmin Jones, Tsige Tafesse, Katherine Tom

## What kind of spaces would you like to engage in? What type of community would you like to build?


## Introduction

BUFU is a collaborative living archive centered around (pan)Black and (pan)Asian cultural and political relationships. We, the founders of this project, are a collective of queer, femme and non-binary, Black and East-Asian artists and organizers. Our goal is to facilitate a global conversation on the relationship between Black & Asian diasporas, with an emphasis on building solidarity, de-centering whiteness, and resurfacing our deeply interconnected and complicated histories. We attempt to achieve this through our collaborative programming, our visual archives, and through building long-term partnerships with collectives, organizations, and individuals. 

The 5 co-founders of this project (Jazmin Jones, Jiun Kwon, Tsige Tafesse, Katherine Tom, and Suhyun Choi) started BUFU in September 2015. Since then, weâ€™ve expanded our work through collaborating with multiple partner organizations, collectives, and individuals. We wish to to highlight the lived experiences of those who have been impacted politically and socially by white supremacy, while de-centering whiteness and resurfacing our deeply interconnected and complicated histories. This evolving archive lives online, on a screen, in an exhibition, in a journal, with endless possibilities for growth.
